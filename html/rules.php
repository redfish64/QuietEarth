      <h2>Main Concept</h2>
      <p>The Quiet Craft is a minecraft plugin, reachable from within minecraft at thequietcraft.com</p>
      <p>In real life, if you die, you disappear and cannot come back (at least that's seems to be the general understanding). 
	The Quiet Craft is meant to resemble that concept to a degree.
	<b id="warn">If you run out of souls in The Quiet Craft,
	  you instantly be teleported out of your world and into a new one, and you won't (normally) be able to come back.
      </b></p>
      <p>This means that, if you go on a PvP rampage, and kill everyone who visited your world, you will probably
	<b><i>NEVER</i></b> see them again. So as you kill them off, you are making your world a more and more lonely place, until
	finally, there is only you. So have fun in your own empty world, you sealed your fate.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you have a griefer that is making everyone angry, maybe you don't <b><i>WANT</i></b> to see them again,
	so feel free to kill them (if you can manage). If you're able to do that, you can rest happily knowing you'll
	not see them anymore.</p>
      <p>But what if everyone seems to be a griefer in your world, then you might want to just end it all and 
	kill yourself. You'll be born in a new world, with, hopefully, new better people to play with, that for
	whatever reason, also didn't like the previous world or were forced out.</p>
      <h2>PvP</h2>
      Killing other players can be fun,  but remember that 
      <b id="warn">everyone you kill will never come back to your world</b>. So in general if you want a fun world 
      it's better to team up with them, become their king and rule them, or have them vote you as president.</b>
<h2>Talking</h2>
When you try saying anything, it's more like real life, in that other people can hear you. They also can hear 
where you are talking from. For example, if you press 'T' and type "Hello there!" after joining, this will
be displayed to other players:
<br>
<blockquote> 
  *direction* &lt;*your name*&gt; shouts "Hello there!"
</blockquote>
For example, if you talk and someone is facing somewhat away from you, they'll get something like
<blockquote> 
  <span id="speech_dir_style">behind left</span> *your name* shouts "Hello there!"
</blockquote>
The direction, "behind left" indicates where the voice is coming from. So, if you want to find the owner of a voice,
you can turn in that direction and look for them. Depending on who is around, 
<span id="warn">it can be dangerous to talk! And by default, you'll shout, attracting people from miles around.</span>

<p>
  You can switch modes with "/shout_mode", "/say_mode", and "/whisper_mode".
  As shown below:
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td id="speech_table_header">Speech Command</td>
      <td id="speech_table_header">Description</td>
    <tr>
      <td id="speech_table_mode">/shout_mode</td>
      <td>Shouts as loud as you can. People anywhere in the world can hear you.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>r
      <td id="speech_table_mode">/say_mode</td>
      <td>Talks in a normal voice. People up to 10,000 blocks can hear you clearly. Up to 15,000 blocks they'll won't hear what
	you are saying, but will know its your character. Up to 20,0000 blocks, they won't know who is talking or what they are
	saying, but they will know that someone is.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td id="speech_table_mode">/whisper_mode</td>
      <td>Whispers. People up to 10 blocks can hear you clearly. Up to 15 blocks they'll won't hear what
	you are saying, but will know its your character. Up to 20 blocks, they won't know who is whispering or what they are
	saying, but they will know that someone is.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<h2>Portals</h2>
When you start, you get a bunch of souls, but also a flint and steel. You may wonder what the purpose is
(besides burning other people). In the Quiet Craft, opening a portal to the nether is serious business.
Everything I said previously about griefers never getting back to your world when you kill them, goes
out the window when you build a portal. <span id="warn">When you open a portal to the nether, anyone else
  from any other world who also built a portal, can now travel through the nether and get to your world.</span>
This includes any griefers you killed. 
<p>So don't build a portal unless you are ready for what comes through it.</p>
<p>That said, the nether can be a very profitable place if you are ready for it</p>
<h2>The Nether</h2>
<p>There are a few important things to keep in mind in the nether.</p>
<ol><li id="warn">If you die in the nether, you will teleport out of your world into a new one, no matter
    how many souls you own.</li>
  <p>All of your souls that died with will be dropped with the rest of your items, as you go off to enjoy your new life.
    Conversely, if you kill someone in the nether, you *get* all their souls.</p> 
  <li id="warn">Going into the nether is the only way to get back to your old world after dying in it</li>
  <p>If you really want to get back to your world, you'll need your friends help. Here are the steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open a portal to the nether</li>
    <li>Have a friend from your old world also open a portal to the nether</li> 
    <li>Have your friend say something, so you can follow his voice and get to the portal leading back to your
      own world. (Keep in mind that everyone else in the nether can hear you, so be very careful doing this)</li>
    <li>Finally to be born again in the old world you were in, you have to sleep in a bed in the old world</li>
  </ol>
