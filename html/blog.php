  <p>The Quiet Craft has been missing something that important for good games, and narratives. There is no resources to fight for.</p>
  <p>QC is basically a wrapper for Minecraft. It allows you to play Minecraft within it, but you can play it infinitely and everywhere. 
  If you want to play Minecraft within QC, you need to find a plot of land, and resources... wood, stone, iron, food, etc. to develop
  that land, and your character.</p>

  <h4>Soul Shards</h4>
  <p>A big problem with QC right now is that the longer you spend
    in a world, the more souls you lose, and the weaker you become. So it makes it that newbies
    are much stronger than those that have been there a long time.</p>
  <p>To fix this, I added "Soul Shards", to help make regulars stronger than newbies</p>
  <h4>Max Souls</h4>
  <p>To add more drama, I'm thinking of making it so when you die, any souls that you have
    over a limit of 10 will be dropped.</p>
  <p>This way, people will need to hide their extra souls somewhere, others can steal them, etc.</p>
  <p>I'm hoping to have a game where fortunes are made and lost, people can be killed and leave the world forever (but this is hard to do).
