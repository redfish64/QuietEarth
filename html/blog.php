  <h4>Soul Shards</h4>
  <p>A big problem with QC right now is that the longer you spend
    in a world, the more souls you lose, and the weaker you become. So it makes it that newbies
    are much stronger than those that have been there a long time.</p>
  <p>To fix this, I added "Soul Shards", to help make regulars stronger than newbies</p>
  <h4>Max Souls</h4>
  <p>To add more drama, I'm thinking of making it so when you die, any souls that you have
    over a limit of 10 will be dropped.</p>
  <p>This way, people will need to hide their extra souls somewhere, others can steal them, etc.</p>
  <p>I'm hoping to have a game where fortunes are made and lost, people can be killed and leave the world forever (but this is hard to do).
